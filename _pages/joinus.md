## Welcome
We welcome all genders, ages, backgrounds and skill levels. Don't worry if you've never used a bow before, we will teach you. If you have already completed training with an accredited instructor then you are welcome to join straight away.  If you haven't been fully trained then you will need to complete our training course before you can become a member.

## Training
Our training courses run when the certified coaches are available. Each course consists of four evening sessions 19:30 until 21:30 on Wednesdays at our indoor venue, Thornwood Village Hall. You must attend all four sessions to become certified and eligible to become a full member.

During the training we will provide you with all the equipment you need. We will teach you the basics and supervise you to ensure your safety and to guide you towards firing with accuracy.  Each course costs Â£60 per person (as of 2023), you will be notified of the current pricing as part of the booking process. Payment is accepted via cash or cheque.

## Full Membership
Our membership year runs from September to August, with the fee being set by the committee at a level to cover the expected costs of the club for the year ahead. If you join us within the year then your membership fee is pro-rated to the remainder of the year.  There are no per-session fees. Membership gives you access to our outdoor range and the Wednesday evening indoor sessions.
